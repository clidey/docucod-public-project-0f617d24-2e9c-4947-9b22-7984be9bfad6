# Value Proposition & Radical Transparency

## Why Trust TapLock?

In today’s mobile ecosystem, trust and privacy are paramount. TapLock addresses these concerns head-on by embracing radical transparency and a privacy-first approach. Unlike many screen-locking apps that operate as opaque, closed-source solutions using broad permissions, TapLock invites you to verify every aspect of its behavior yourself.

## Core Privacy and Trust Features

- **Fully Open-Source**: Every line of TapLock's source code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/modelorona/TapLock). This transparency empowers you and the community to audit, review, and contribute to its security and functionality.

- **No Internet Permissions**: TapLock deliberately excludes any internet access permissions. It cannot send or receive data, eliminating a common vector for data leakage and tracking.

- **Minimal Codebase**: With a focused and concise codebase, TapLock simplifies the review process, ensuring no hidden features or unwanted behaviors lurk beneath the surface.

- **No Personal Data Collection**: TapLock’s sole use of the Accessibility Service is strictly to detect double taps and lock the screen. It does not collect or log any user data, interactions, or behavior.

- **No Third-Party Analytics or Tracking**: To further secure your privacy, TapLock does not integrate any analytics services or trackers, ensuring your app usage remains private and confined to your device.

## Why This Matters

Many apps requiring the Accessibility Service have broad permissions that can access sensitive interactions or screen content. When these apps are closed-source, users must trust the developer without evidence. TapLock eliminates this guesswork by providing full source visibility and minimal permission use.

This means:

- You control your security and privacy — no hidden data collection.
- You can verify TapLock’s behavior yourself or through independent audits.
- The app design focuses solely on providing a quick, efficient double-tap lock function without unnecessary bloat.

## Transparency in Action

TapLock’s commitment goes beyond promises; it is implemented as follows:

- The [AndroidManifest.xml](app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) shows only the essential Accessibility Service permission.
- The app's [MainActivity](app/src/main/java/com/ah/taplock/MainActivity.kt) offers full control and clear information about permissions, configured entirely within the app with no telemetry.
- The service implementation ([TapLockAccessibilityService.kt](app/src/main/java/com/ah/taplock/TapLockAccessibilityService.kt)) strictly uses system calls to lock the screen without special data access.

This openness ensures that users never have to ‘trust blindly’ but can instead place confidence in verified facts.

## Best Practices for Privacy-Conscious Users

- **Review the source code** yourself or rely on community audits.
- **Verify permissions** granted to the app in your device settings.
- **Avoid apps that request excessive permissions without transparency.**
- **Prefer minimal apps** that do one thing well — like TapLock.

<Tip>
TapLock intentionally excludes internet access and data collection capabilities — sharing none of your information externally. This design choice is rare for such apps and the foundation of its trustworthiness.
</Tip>

## Summary

TapLock’s value proposition is crystal clear: provide a privacy-first, trustworthy, and verifiable tool to lock your Android device with a double tap. Its radical transparency model invites you to inspect, verify, and rest assured that your privacy is never compromised.

You’re not just using TapLock — you’re holding it accountable.
