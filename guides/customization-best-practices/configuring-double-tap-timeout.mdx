# Configuring Double-Tap Timeout

Unlock the full potential of TapLock by fine-tuning the double-tap timeout — the time window within which two taps on the widget must occur to trigger a lock. Whether you tap quickly or prefer a more deliberate gesture, adjusting this setting empowers you to personalize your screen locking experience, preventing accidental locks while ensuring responsiveness tailored to your pace.

## Workflow Overview

### What You Will Achieve
This guide walks you through **adjusting the double-tap recognition timeout** in TapLock’s settings. You'll learn how to set your preferred timeout in milliseconds, balancing speed and accuracy for your double-tap lock gesture.

### Prerequisites
- TapLock must be installed and successfully added as a widget on your Android home screen.
- Accessibility Service permission for TapLock must be enabled to detect taps and lock the screen.
- Familiarity with opening apps and using basic device settings.

### Expected Outcome
- You will confidently customize the double-tap timeout value.
- The TapLock widget will recognize double taps within your specified timeout, optimizing your user experience based on your tapping speed.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner – no technical knowledge required.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the TapLock Application">
Launch TapLock from your app drawer or home screen. This takes you to the main settings screen where personalization options are available.
</Step>

<Step title="Locate the Double Tap Timeout Setting">
In the app, find the input labeled **'Double Tap Timeout (ms)'**. This field indicates the time interval TapLock listens for between two taps, with the default set at **300 ms**.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Your Preferred Timeout">
Tap the timeout input box and enter a value in milliseconds that matches your tapping speed:
- Smaller values (e.g., 200–300 ms) suit fast tappers, making lock recognition more sensitive and immediate.
- Larger values (e.g., 400–600 ms) accommodate slower taps, reducing missed double taps.

Make sure to input only numeric values.
</Step>

<Step title="Save Your Timeout Setting">
Tap the **Update** button next to the input field to save your new timeout.
You will see a brief toast notification confirming that the timeout has been updated.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Your New Timeout">
Go to your home screen and double-tap the TapLock widget to test if locking behavior matches your expectations.
If you experience accidental locks or failures to lock, revisit the setting and try a different timeout value.
</Step>

<Step title="Adjust if Necessary">
Repeat the adjustment and testing process until you find a timeout that feels natural and reliable to your tapping rhythm.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Start with the default **300 ms** if unsure, then adjust up or down incrementally by 50 ms until comfortable.
- Avoid setting a timeout too low (< 200 ms) unless you consistently tap very fast; this can cause missed double taps.
- Setting a very high timeout (> 600 ms) might cause accidental locks by recognizing unrelated taps as double taps.
- If you experience frequent accidental locks, slightly increase the timeout.
- Use the update button promptly after entering a new value to ensure changes take effect.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Timeout Settings">
<Accordion title="Timeout Input Not Updating">
If tapping **Update** yields no confirmation or change:
- Ensure your input is numeric with no extra spaces or letters.
- The app may require you to clear the field first before typing a new number.
- Restart the app to refresh state if the issue persists.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Locking Does Not Trigger After Timeout Change">
- Confirm that Accessibility Service permission remains enabled.
- Check that the widget is correctly added to your home screen.
- Try resetting to default timeout 300 ms and test again.
- If problem continues, consult the Troubleshooting & FAQ guide.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Accidental Locks Happening Frequently">
- The timeout value may be too high.
- Decrease the timeout gradually to prevent recognizing unrelated taps as double taps.
- Ensure the widget is placed somewhere unlikely to be tapped unintentionally.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Interface Walkthrough & Visual Guide

TapLock's timeout configuration is part of its streamlined one-screen settings interface:

- **Double Tap Timeout (ms) Input:** A numeric text field where you enter the timeout value.
- **Update Button:** Saves the new timeout; disabled when input is empty.
- **Toast Notification:** Confirms successful change.

_Example UI snippet:_

```text
+------------------------------------+
| Settings                          |
|                                  |
| Double Tap Timeout (ms): [ 300 ] |  <-- Tap here and enter new value
| [Update]                        |
+------------------------------------+
```
