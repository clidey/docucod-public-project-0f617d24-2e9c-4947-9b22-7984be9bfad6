## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Add the TapLock Widget to Your Home Screen (If Not Done Yet)
If you haven’t already placed the TapLock widget, follow these quick steps:

- Long press an empty space on your home screen.
- Tap "Widgets" from the options menu.
- Locate "TapLock" in the widget list.
- Drag and drop the widget onto your desired spot on the home screen.

### 2. Enable Widget Transparency
By default, the TapLock widget supports a transparent mode that allows it to blend with your home screen background. This mode keeps the widget invisible yet fully functional.

- No additional toggle or setting is necessary; the widget is transparent out-of-the-box.

### 3. Resize the TapLock Widget
To resize the widget to better fit your screen layout and preferences:

- Long press the TapLock widget on your home screen.
- Release your finger when the widget enters resize mode (you’ll see dots or borders around it).
- Drag the edges or corners to make the widget larger or smaller.
- Confirm the new size by tapping outside the widget area or pressing the back/home button.

> **Tip:** Start with a small widget size around 40dp x 40dp to keep it discreet but easy to tap.

### 4. Choose the Best Placement
For optimal usability and to avoid accidental taps on other elements:

- Place the TapLock widget in a corner or edge of your home screen.
- Prefer a spot that’s easy to reach with your thumb if you use one-handed mode.
- Avoid overlapping or placing near frequently used apps or shortcuts.

### 5. Test the Setup
Once you’ve adjusted size and placement:

- Perform a double tap on the invisible widget area to verify it locks your screen.
- If the screen locks, your widget is correctly set up.
- If not, ensure the Accessibility Service permission is enabled (see [Initial Setup & Enabling Permissions](https://your-documentation-link/getting-started/setup-and-installation/initial-setup-and-enabling-permissions)).

## Practical Example

Imagine you want a clean home screen without extra icons or buttons visible, yet you want to lock your device quickly without using hardware keys:

1. Add the TapLock widget in the bottom-left corner (a thumb-friendly area).
2. Resize it to the smallest size allowed (about the size of a standard app icon).
3. Because the widget is transparent, it looks like an empty spot.
4. Double-tap that invisible spot anytime to lock your device instantly.

This setup perfectly suits minimalist home screen layouts or users who dislike visual clutter.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Widget Not Resizing**
  - Ensure your launcher supports widget resizing.
  - Some custom launchers may restrict widget size — try a standard launcher or update your launcher app.

- **Double Tap Not Detected After Resizing**
  - Confirm Accessibility Service permission is active.
  - Restart your device if issues persist.

- **Widget Visible Instead of Transparent**
  - This may occur if a custom launcher applies a background or overlay.
  - Check launcher settings for widget backgrounds or shadows.

### Best Practices

- Resize the widget to balance ease of double tapping and discretion.
- Favor edges or corners to minimize accidental taps on other home screen elements.
- Regularly verify Accessibility Service permissions after system updates.

### Performance Considerations

- The transparent widget is lightweight and imposes negligible performance impact.
- Resizing does not affect TapLock’s responsiveness.

### Alternative Approaches

- You can keep the widget at default size and use a semi-transparent custom icon if you want slight visual feedback.
- For users who prefer visual cues, adjusting the widget size upwards can help.
