## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions for Using the TapLock Widget

### Step 1: Place the TapLock Widget on Your Home Screen

1. Long press on an empty space on your Android home screen.

<Check>
Make sure the widget is positioned where a double tap can be comfortably performed.
</Check>

### Step 2: Enable Accessibility Service (If Not Already Enabled)

1. Tap the app or widget shortcut to launch TapLock settings.
2. When prompted, agree to enable the Accessibility Service required for TapLock.
3. This opens the Accessibility settings screen. Locate "TapLock Accessibility Service".
4. Toggle it on to grant permission.
5. Return to the home screen.

<Warning>
Accessibility Service is essential for TapLock to detect double taps and lock your screen. Without this, the widget will not function.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Perform a Double Tap on the Widget to Lock the Screen

1. Tap the widget once.
2. Within the configured timeout interval (default 300 milliseconds), immediately tap the widget again.
3. When the second tap is registered within the timeout, the screen will lock instantly.

<Tip>
The responsiveness depends on the double-tap timeout setting. Adjust this in the app's settings screen if your double taps feel too slow or too fast.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Verify Visual and Functional Feedback

- The widget is designed to be transparent and minimally intrusive, so it may not give explicit visual changes on tap.
- After a successful double tap, your device's screen turns off immediately indicating success.

<Check>
If your screen locks instantly after the double tap, the widget is working correctly.
</Check>

## 3. Real-World Interaction Flow Explained

Once placed on your home screen, the widget listens for taps.

- On first tap: The widget records the tap timestamp.
- On second tap within timeout: Triggers the Accessibility Service to lock the screen.
- If second tap is beyond timeout: The tap timestamp resets, requiring a fresh double tap.

This ensures accidental taps do not lock your screen unexpectedly.
