# First Successful Run: Locking Your Screen

Unlock the full convenience and privacy of TapLock by performing your first double tap to lock your Android device’s screen. This guide walks you through an end-to-end run—from confirming setup, understanding what happens during double tap, to verifying TapLock’s privacy safeguards and expected outcomes.

---

## 1. Confirm Your Setup is Ready

Before locking your screen with TapLock, ensure the foundational steps are in place:

- **Widget Added**: A transparent TapLock widget must be placed on your Android home screen. If you haven’t done this yet:
  1. Long-press an empty area on your home screen.
  2. Select "Widgets".
  3. Find and drag the "TapLock" widget to the desired spot.

- **Accessibility Service Enabled**: TapLock relies on Accessibility Service permission to detect your double taps and lock the screen.
  - On your device, open TapLock app.
  - Locate the "Accessibility Service" section in Settings.
  - If not enabled, tap "Enable" and follow the Android system prompts to turn on accessibility for TapLock.

- **Double-Tap Timeout Configured (Optional)**: The timeout controls how quickly the two taps must occur. Default is 300 milliseconds.
  - Open TapLock app.
  - Adjust the double-tap timeout value to suit your tapping rhythm.
  - Tap "Update" to save.

<Tip>
You can revisit the setup steps anytime in the [Initial Setup & Enabling Permissions](https://yourdocs.example.com/getting-started/setup-and-installation/initial-setup-and-enabling-permissions) guide for detailed instructions.

## 2. Perform Your First Double Tap

Follow these simple steps for your first lock:

1. Ensure your device is unlocked and the home screen with the TapLock widget is visible.
2. Quickly double tap on the transparent TapLock widget.

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- The widget detects your double tap within the configured timeout.
- TapLock's Accessibility Service intercepts this gesture.
- The device locks instantly using the system's screen lock action.

<Check>
You should see the device screen turn off and lock immediately without delays.
</Check>

## 3. Understanding Privacy Safeguards During the Operation

TapLock has been crafted with privacy-first principles:

- **No data collection:** The Accessibility Service permission is used solely to detect the double tap and lock the screen; it does not monitor your activity or log any interaction.
- **Open Source Transparency:** Every line of code is publicly available to reassure users of privacy.
- **No network permissions:** The app cannot transmit any data.

<Info>
TapLock only listens for the double tap gesture on its own widget and performs the lock action. It does not access or send any other data.
</Info>

## 4. Verify TapLock is Working Correctly

To confirm TapLock is functioning optimally, use the following verification checklist:

- **Screen Locks Instantly:** After double tapping the widget, the screen must go off and lock without error or delay.
- **No Lock Without Double Tap:** The screen should not lock from accidental taps or other gestures.
- **Accessibility Service Status:** Open the app and ensure the accessibility permission is enabled and active.

If all these are true, you have successfully completed your first run.

<Warning>
If double tap does not lock the screen:
- Verify accessibility service is enabled via system settings.
- Check the widget is properly added and not covered by other UI elements.
- Confirm the double-tap timeout is reasonable (e.g., 300ms).
- Restart your device and try again.
</Warning>

## 5. Next Steps: Enhancing Your TapLock Experience

After successfully locking your screen the first time, consider exploring:

- **Customize Double-Tap Timeout:** Adjust responsiveness in the app settings to best match your tapping speed.
- **Resize or Move the Widget:** Tailor placement and size for ergonomic one-handed use.
- **Explore Privacy Details:** Review the [Value Proposition & Radical Transparency](https://yourdocs.example.com/overview/intro-value/value-prop-differentiation) for deeper insight into TapLock's trust model.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Double Tap Not Detected
- Ensure you are tapping the exact location of the TapLock widget.
- Check no other apps or widgets obstruct touches over TapLock.
- Try adjusting the double-tap timeout to a higher value.

### Accessibility Service Disabled or Not Working
- Go to Android system Settings > Accessibility > TapLock, and ensure the service is enabled.
- Sometimes toggling it off and on again helps.

### Screen Does Not Lock After Double Tap
- Verify device lock settings and permissions allow screen locking.
- Check battery optimization is not restricting TapLock.

<Tip>
Restarting your device often resolves permission or service glitches.

## Code Reference

For users interested in the underlying code that enables this primary function, the Accessibility Service central to this flow is implemented here:

```kotlin
// app/src/main/java/com/ah/taplock/TapLockAccessibilityService.kt
class TapLockAccessibilityService : AccessibilityService() {
    override fun onStartCommand(intent: Intent?, flags: Int, startId: Int): Int {
        if (intent?.action == Intent.ACTION_SCREEN_OFF) {
            performGlobalAction(GLOBAL_ACTION_LOCK_SCREEN)
        }
        return super.onStartCommand(intent, flags, startId)
    }

    override fun onAccessibilityEvent(event: AccessibilityEvent?) {}
    override fun onInterrupt() {}
}
```

This service listens for the screen-off intent triggered by your double tap and locks the device securely.
