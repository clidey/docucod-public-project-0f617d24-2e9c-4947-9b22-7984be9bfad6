## 1. Accessibility Service Not Enabling or Not Working

The Accessibility Service is essential for TapLock to detect your double taps and lock the screen.

### Symptoms
- "Enable" button disabled or nothing happens when you try to enable the service.
- Double tap does not lock the screen.

### Solutions
- **Manually Enable Accessibility Service:**
  1. Open your device `Settings`.
  2. Navigate to `Accessibility` > `Installed Services` or `TapLock`.
  3. Find the TapLock Accessibility Service and enable it.
  4. Confirm any permission prompts.

- **Check if Accessibility Service is Running:**
  - Open the TapLock app; it shows the service status.
  - If disabled, try enabling manually.

- **Restart Your Device:** Sometimes Android restricts service enabling until a reboot.

- **Avoid Battery Optimizations:**
  - TapLock’s service might be stopped by aggressive battery saving modes.
  - Go to `Settings` > `Battery` > `Battery Optimization`.
  - Exclude TapLock from optimization or background restrictions.

<Tip>
Ensure you only grant accessibility permission to trusted apps, as it allows interaction monitoring. TapLock uses it solely to lock your screen via double tap.
</Tip>

## 2. Widget Not Appearing on Home Screen or Missing

### Symptoms
- After installing, you can’t find the TapLock widget.
- Widget appears but is unresponsive.

### Solutions
- **Adding the Widget Properly:**
  1. Long press on your home screen.
  2. Tap on `Widgets`.
  3. Scroll to find the “TapLock” widget.
  4. Drag and drop it where you want.

- **Launcher Compatibility:**
  - Some custom launchers may not properly show widgets.
  - Try switching temporarily to the default Android launcher.

## 3. Double Tap Does Not Lock the Screen

### Symptoms
- Double tapping the widget seems to do nothing.

### Solutions
- **Verify Accessibility Service is Enabled:** The service must be active.
- **Check Double-Tap Timeout:**
  - Open TapLock app.
  - Adjust the double tap timeout setting in the app (default is 300ms).
  - A too-short or too-long timeout may cause missed detection.

- **Use the Correct Widget:**
  - Confirm you are tapping the TapLock widget, not an icon or shortcut.

- **Screen Locking Not Supported on Device:**
  - Some OEMs limit screen locking commands.
  - TapLock uses Android’s `GLOBAL_ACTION_LOCK_SCREEN`; if your device blocks it, double tap won’t work.

- **Clear App Cache and Data:**
  1. Go to `Settings` > `Apps` > `TapLock`.
  2. Tap `Storage & Cache`.
  3. Clear cache, then clear data.
  4. Restart the app and reconfigure.
- **Reinstall TapLock:**
  - Uninstall and reinstall fresh.

## 5. FAQs

### Why does TapLock need Accessibility Service permission?

TapLock uses Accessibility Service solely to detect double taps and lock your screen. It doesn't access or collect any other data.

### Is TapLock safe and private?

Yes. TapLock is 100% open source, does not require internet permission, and does not collect data. You can audit the entire codebase yourself.

### How do I adjust the sensitivity of the double tap?

You can customize the double tap timeout in milliseconds inside the TapLock app's Settings screen.

### I enabled accessibility but the widget still doesn’t work. What do I do?

Try restarting your device, disable battery optimizations for TapLock, and confirm the widget is correctly added and resized.

### Can I lock my screen without add TapLock widget?

No. The widget is the visible trigger for the double tap gesture. The app requires it on your home screen.
