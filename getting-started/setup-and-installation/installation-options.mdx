### Verifying Installation:

## 3. Building and Installing from Source

If you value radical transparency and want to inspect or modify TapLock's code before installing, you can build the app yourself.

### Prerequisites

- A development machine running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- [Android Studio Hedgehog](https://developer.android.com/studio) or later installed
- Git installed to clone the source repository

### Downloading the Source

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the TapLock repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modelorona/TapLock.git
```

3. Change directory into the project folder:

```bash
cd TapLock
```

### Opening the Project

1. Launch Android Studio.
2. Choose 'Open an Existing Project' and select the cloned `TapLock` directory.
3. Allow Gradle to synchronize and download dependencies.

### Build Configuration Details

- The app targets Android SDK 34 and requires a minimum SDK 31.
- Uses Kotlin 2.0.0 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.7.2.
- Compose UI enabled for a modern interface.

### Building the APK

Run the following command in the project root within a terminal or use the Build menu in Android Studio:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

This generates a debug APK located in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

### Installing the APK on Your Device

Connect your Android device with USB debugging enabled, then install with:

```bash
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Alternatively, transfer the APK to your device and open it to install manually.

<Warning>
Ensure your device allows installation from unknown sources if installing manually.
</Warning>

## 4. Verifying Your Installation

2. Confirm you see the home screen explaining the widget and permissions.
3. Follow prompts to enable the Accessibility Service for TapLock as described in the app.

<Info>
Accessibility Service is required for TapLock to detect your double taps and lock the screen securely.
